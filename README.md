# notifications

The Notification component provides all the tools needed to build a complete notification system.

It provides an infrastructure for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including email, sms, and Slack, as well as the ability to create additional channels for new delivery methods. Notifications may also be stored in a database so they may be displayed in your web interface.
